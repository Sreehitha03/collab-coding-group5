# Contributing to Collab Coding Project

## Overview
This project is a collaborative collection of math utility functions.

## Branching
- Create a branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature-yourname-function`
- Never commit directly to `main`

## Coding Guidelines
- Use clear function names
- Include docstrings with description, input/output, and author
- Keep code clean and readable

## Unit Tests
- Add tests in `tests/test_<function>.py`
- Test normal cases and edge cases
- Run tests locally before pushing: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## Pull Request Process
1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`
3. At least one peer must review your PR before merge
4. Resolve merge conflicts if any

## Tips
- Keep commits small and meaningful
- Use descriptive commit messages
